			The brain controls movement, balance, posture and pain. It is the master coordinator controlling every aspect of our lives. A change in the vestibular system may lead to scoliosis. A change in the cerebellum may result in repeated shoulder injuries. In this course we will be looking at areas of the brain that are the most relevant to movement, balance, posture and pain. We will cover the conditions that most commonly present in your clinic and discuss how the nervous system is responsible for and affected by those conditions.
			<br><br>
			This is a highly practical course with real case studies.

			The vestibular system is one of the most crucial areas of the nervous system. It’s one of the first areas to fully mature and the input that it provides impacts movement, balance, posture, curvature of spine, memory, cognition, spatial awareness, and the list goes on!
			<br><br>
			Dizziness is one of the top reasons for patients to consult their primary care physician and is one of the leading causes of disability. Treating the vestibular system is a crucial part of healthcare and it needs to be treated with precision.
			<br><br>
			This is an extremely practical session.

			This course is always my favourite. Each member of your group, or your group as a whole decides what they would like to cover. I will then create a seminar based on the topics you chose. A truly 100% tailored seminar. As you choose the topics covered participants normally find this day particularly rewarding.
			<br><br>
			Previous requested topics have been; ADHD and autism, changes in posture with Parkinson’s disease, how does the vestibular system impact body awareness.
			<br><br>
			If you’re unsure if you have a suitable topic idea just send me an email at jake@bcneuro.co.uk and I’ll let you know.

		The small group sizes hopefully allow the use of your own clinic as the location for the seminar. If there is not enough space, or your clinic is unsuitable, I am able to organise a location for hire. The cost will be added to the price of the seminar.
		<br><br>
		If you wish to attend a seminar but aren’t able to form a group of sufficient size, please contact me, I may be able to help find a suitable group for you to join.
